# Python Faded Parsons Problems with Visual Output

This tool should allow you to run Faded Parsons Problems in static page in the browser, with visual results, using [pyp5js](https://github.com/berinhard/pyp5js/) (_pyodide_ and the _p5js_ canvas) to show the sketch results, as written with puzzle blocks in a dialect close to [py5](https://py5coding.org) in *imported mode* style.

Based on [faded-parsons-static](https://github.com/pamelafox/faded-parsons-static/) by Pamela Fox, with help from many people! With special thanks to [Luciano Ratamero](https://github.com/lucianoratamero) who adapted & inserted *pyp5js* and made this all work.

## Work in progress, working prototype!

## A quick way to make and publish your own puzzles

You can fork this repository, edit the YAML files in the `parsons_prob` folder as explained bellow, and set the GitHub Pages settings to publish your own page, or upload on some other webhosting server. This tool is based on "static pages", so uploading the files (mostly html, js, yaml, images and etc.) is all there is to it.

## If you want to know more and contribute with this tool/project 

### Setting up a local development environmet

Be sure to have `nodejs` installed. To install `nodejs`, go to their download page and download the installer for your operating system: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

We will assume you have at least some familiarity with the command line. After installing, open a terminal, go to the project's folder using `cd` (the one you're in right now) and run:

`npm install`

This will install all the dependencies for the website.

If you don't have `npm` installed, double check the installation instructions for `nodejs` for your operating system.

### Running the website locally 

From the download directory:

`npm run dev`

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8000/ where you can see the website. Also, whenever you change something in the code, reload the page to see the changes.

### Building the website

To make the site ready for deployment, run:

`npm run build`

This will recreate the `dist` folder with the website ready to be deployed.

### Deploying the website

The website can be deployed anywhere since it's entirely static. You can enable the GitHub Pages feature on your own fork of the repo to host it as currently is done with the working prototype example at https://abav.lugaralgum.com/faded-parsons-visual/ served from the main branch of this repo using the files `index.html` (home page) and `problem.html` (puzzle page). The README.md is not the starting page because of the `index.html` presence.

## Adding a new problem

Add files to the `parson_probs` folder:

- `problem_file.yaml`: This is a YAML file that includes the problem description (HTML) and code lines with blanks.

- You should add an image to the description, like `problem_file.png`, in the same folder.

- Example `000_variables.yaml` that uses `000_variables.png` in the same folder:

```yaml

problem_name: Variables

problem_subtitle: assignement

problem_category: Getting Started

problem_description: |
  <img src="parsons_probs/000_variables.png"></br>
  <h5>Variables</h5>
  <code>assignement</code></br>
  Organize blocks of lines to make the drawing above.
  Notice indentation matters.

code_lines: |
  def setup(): #0given
  size(400, 400) #1given
  background(200) # fundo cinza
  nome = '!BLANK'
  text(nome, 20, 180)  # desenha o texto de `nome`
  # Se tentar usar a variável `a` antes de criar...
  # ... vai ter um erro do tipo NameError (não conheço `a`)
  a = 10  # cria a variável `a` que aponta para o valor 10
  square(a, 10, 140)  # desenha um quadrado de lado 140 em x:10, y:10
  a = a + 145  # calcula o valor de `a + 145` e muda a variável `a`
  square(a, 10, !BLANK)  # desenha um quadrado de lado 140
```

Then you can access the new problem at **`.../problem.html?name=problem_file`**

### Updating the index/home page

The Python script [`update_index.py`](https://github.com/villares/faded-parsons-visual/blob/hack/update_index.py), that depends on *Beautiful Soup 4*, will look for YAML problems in the `parsons_probs` folder, check the category and update the `index.html` with links to all the problems found.

### Automating YAML generation from puzzle source code 

Also inside the `parson_probs` folder, you will find some `.py` files that contain [py5 code, in imported mode style](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/como-instalar-py5/index-EN.html) for a problem, with added annotations like `#0given` as explained above, and some extra special comments containing `!REMOVE` on some lines, as well as commented out lines with code containing `!BLANK`. Those scripts will generate the YAML problem file and the image file for the problem description.
